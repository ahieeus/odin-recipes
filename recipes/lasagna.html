    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here we are, heading straight into the heart of holiday and special occasion dinner party season. And while the main courses and side dishes might vary, one thing these types of gatherings usually have in common is a basket of rich, buttery dinner rolls on the table. And with that scene in mind, there are few dinner rolls as rich and buttery as the aptly named butterhorns.</p>
    <p>You might have grown up calling these crescent rolls, since that's what was printed on the side of the cardboard tube from the store, but I think butterhorns is way cooler of a name. The only real difference, besides the fact that these are so much better, is that crescent rolls are shaped into a crescent versus the usually straighter design of your average butterhorn. Basically, all crescent rolls are butterhorns, but not all butterhorns are crescent rolls.</p>
